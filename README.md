# Prototypes Challenge

This is the afternoon challenge for data types from Coder Academy.

## Running

1. First, clone this repository to your computer.
2. Then run `yarn install` to set up the dependencies -- you'll only need to run this **once**
3. Then run `yarn test` to run the tests.
  1. This will start a "file watcher" that will automatically run your tests when your code changes.
  2. You can hit `Ctrl+C` to exit this process.
4. Attempt to fix the failing tests. Taking them on one at a time.
